# Aurdrino-reactive-LED
Create a reactive programmable led strip, that response to music using circular LED's.

I have used the code provided with a little modification but have found that it does not match the music very well and seems kind of random. I hae a cheap old usb led that seems to match the beat really well but can't get these programable led's to work.
